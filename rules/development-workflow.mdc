# Development Workflow — ChartVolt

## 🔍 Before Any Change

1. **Study first, code second.** Read relevant files, trace symbols to definitions, and verify behavior from code — never assume.
2. **Use vector-database docs and All MCP Avaliable Including MCP Context7** as primary context when available.
3. **Confirm file paths and module names exist** before referencing them.

## 🧩 Structured Approach

### Phase 1 — Analysis

- Identify bugs, inconsistencies, code smells, and architectural weaknesses.
- Provide **root cause analysis** with evidence (file paths, function names, logic).
- Confirm reproducibility conditions for detected bugs.
- Detect performance bottlenecks (CPU, memory, I/O, rendering, network, DB).
- Do **not** speculate — be precise and evidence-based.

### Phase 2 — Plan

For each issue:

1. Explain root cause clearly.
2. Propose the **minimal effective fix**.
3. Suggest refactoring improvements (if applicable).
4. Suggest performance improvements (if measurable).
5. List trade-offs and risks.
6. Highlight edge cases.

Prefer the **simplest robust solution**. Avoid overengineering.

### Phase 3 — Implementation

- Implement fixes **carefully and incrementally**.
- Preserve existing functionality unless change is justified.
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible.
- Optimize only where **measurable gains** exist.
- Avoid speculative optimizations and breaking changes.

## 📐 Code Structure & Modularity

- **Max 500 lines per file.** If approaching this limit, split into modules or helpers.
- Organize code into **clearly separated modules** grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Use **clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- Follow **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and modern stable technologies.

## 📚 Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** — target a mid-level developer's comprehension.
- For complex logic, add an inline `// Reason:` comment explaining **why**, not just what.

## 🛡️ AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context** — search the codebase or ask if uncertain.
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** — only use verified, existing packages.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed or required by the task.
- **Never introduce unnecessary complexity.**
- If architectural-level changes are required, **justify them before implementing**.

## ✅ Quality Checklist

- Code is clean, readable, and scalable.
- Solutions are simple and production-ready.
- Best coding practices are followed.
- Latest stable technologies are used where appropriate.
